Supply Chain Service Level Agreement

Solico Group is the biggest dairy company which is even popular through the middle east food and beverage industry. The company is a holding that includes several companies that are collaborating. 

Having an official service level agreement was one of the most critical issues through the organization. According to this agreement, we set a new agreement between the business department and logistic department.
